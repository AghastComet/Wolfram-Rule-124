# Wolfram-Rule-124
Some programs based on Wolfram's 2D cellular automita, rule 124

How to use:
  Once run, it will ask how many itterations to do, each step will be printed
  Next, it will ask for the initial sequence. For example, 110101101. The whole sequence has to be input at once with no spaces.

How it works:
  It uses the equasion (p+q+pq+pqr) mod 2, where p is one up and to the left, q is one up, and r is one up and to the right.
